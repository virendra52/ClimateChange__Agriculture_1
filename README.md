 # Climate Change Impact on Agriculture - Power BI Dashboard

This repository contains an interactive **Power BI Dashboard** that visualizes and analyzes the global impact of **climate change on agriculture**. The dashboard uses multi-dimensional data to present trends and patterns across various regions and crop types.

---

# Key Metrics

- Average Temperature:** 152.4K (indicative scale)
- Crop Types Covered:** 10,000+
- Total Precipitation:** 16.12 Million mm
- Total Economic Impact:** $6.74 Million
- Average Weather Index:** 4.98

---

# Dashboard Features

- Soil Health Index by Region**
- Fertilizer Use by Crop Type** (Barley, Cotton, Corn, Coffee, Fruits)
- Irrigation Access % by Crop and Region**
- Crop Yield Comparison** (Wheat, Coffee, Vegetables, Rice, Barley)
- Total Precipitation by Region**
- CO₂ Emissions Over Time** (1990–2025)
- Average Temperature by Region**
- Interactive Geo-Map**: Crop Types by Country

---

# Covered Regions and Countries

- Countries:** India, Canada, China
- Regions:** British Columbia, Central, East, Maharashtra, South, North, Punjab, Victoria, etc.

# Project Purpose

To understand the complex relationship between **climate change indicators** (temperature, precipitation, CO₂ emissions) and **agricultural productivity**, including:

- Crop yield
- Soil health
- Irrigation access
- Economic impact

This analysis can support **policy makers, researchers, and environmental analysts** in making data-driven decisions.
